        "First of all, let’s begin with the belief that organic food is better for you - that’s simply untrue.",
        "Actual studies show there is no advantage whatsoever when all else is equal.",
        "The variables that affect nutrient quality have more to do with conditions like soil management, disease, weather, etc… and that’s the case regardless of farming process.",
        "An organic tomato grown in Florida is going to have poorer nutrient quality to a conventional tomato grown in California - that’s just down to soil.",
        "Moreover, the techniques that farmers use to manage soil quality and account for weather and so on are the same for organic vs. conventional farming techniques.",
        "They’re actually the same techniques farmers have been using pretty much since the dawn of civilization - modern technology has merely improved the efficiency and scale at which they can do it.",
        "Let’s also remember that the farming industry isn’t one in which quality drives the economy; Quantity, on the other hand, does.",
        "More specifically, the money a farmer makes isn’t a function of nutrients or flavor.",
        "It’s a function of the total weight of yield.",
        "While an organic farmer can make a little more per kilo of yield, the total weight for a given amount of input labor and operating costs is less as well, so farmers don’t actually make good money on organic.",
        "As far as taste/flavor goes, studies show that organic vs. conventional is basically a tie.",
        "Moreover, there are also studies that strongly indicate that the perceived flavor advantage of organic food is entirely down to expectations.",
        "In blind tests, things come out basically even (again, assuming all else equal), but if people are told that one is organic and one is conventional, the one they were told is organic tends to win, even if the subjects of the study were actually misled.",
        "Moreover, much like with MSG, if subjects were told that one was GMO and one was not, the subjects often experienced ill effects, again, even if they were lied to about it; The same subjects never experience that if they’re never informed in the first place.",
        "Also, many people believe that organic food means no pesticides or herbicides.",
        "That’s actually a myth.",
        "What they’re not permitted to use is synthetic pesticides and herbicides.",
        "Natural ones are actually allowed (and there are several of these), and they are used in large quantities.",
        "As it so happens, this is actually less “green”, because naturally sourced pesticides and herbicides tend to carry all sorts of impurities, and offer lower efficacy, which actually means that organic farmers have to use more of it to get their yields up to manageable levels… Synthetic pesticides and herbicides are more effective, can be used in smaller quantities, and are higher purity, which actually makes them many times safer and cause less contaminated runoff.",
        "In fact, all outbreaks of food-borne illness from vegetables sold in the U.S. in the last 30 years have been connected exclusively to organic vegetables.",
        "The only legitimate illness prevention that organic offers (and more specifically, it’s only there in the sense that it is an explicit requirement of organic meats) is that livestock feed cannot contain any animal byproducts, which thereby reduces the risk of Mad Cow disease… there’s really nothing else you can explicitly tie to organic food.",
        "Really, the only reason why people don’t realize this (or believe it if the facts are laid bare) is because of their atavistic response to the idea of synthetic chemicals and the idea that that makes them inherently harmful and that anything natural is inherently good.",
        "Similarly, the notion of no antibiotics or hormones in organic is also a myth.",
        "What it actually is that that there are no antibiotics or hormones used specifically for purposes other than to treat diseases and/or disorders.",
        "And also, any notion that these things are necessarily harmful betrays an inordinate ignorance about biochemistry, but that’s exactly why people fear it so much in the first place.",
        "There’s not even the slightest shade of evidence that these things actually affect humans in any way.",
        "Also, a meat that is certified organic does not mean that all of the feed stock is organically grown; it’s around 80%, and exceptions can be made if there are known nutrient deficiencies in the feed stock.",
        "There are some people who believe that buying organic helps small or local farmers, and that too is a myth.",
        "As mentioned before, organic is now a huge industry, and it bears all the same “evil corporate” characteristics one would associate with conventional “factory” farming.",
        "You can support local growers by paying more at farmers markets, but one should take notice of the fact that this is actually a less environmentally sound approach.",
        "Economies of scale actually make industrialized farming more eco-friendly overall.",
        "While organic growers ostensibly make more per unit weight than conventional farmers, the fact that they are cut off from a host of technological advances means that it is not even a theoretical possiblity for them to obtain equivalent yields on the same resource input.",
        "It turns out in practice that for all farm owners who own both conventional and organic plots, they make less money per acre on organic (again, assuming apples to apples, of course).",
        "There is some degree of correlation between organic and lower incidence of cruel treatment of livestock.",
        "it is debatable how much of this is related to the political image maintenance of organic food, and how much is because it is merely possible since organic is still a smaller subset of the overall food market.",
        "It should be known that everything we associate with so-called “factory” farming exists for one and only one reason - to meet market demand.",
        "That said, in spite of the propaganda campaigns, it should be also known that the horrifying images we have all seen are actually not as large an issue as demagogues would have you believe.",
        "Oh, they are real, but the statistics do not support any of the claims that some would have you believe.",
        "Buying organic or pushing for cruelty-free practices in all kinds of farming?",
        "To a certain extent, I am torn on this one since all dollars are infinitely more powerful than all votes, but to be able to pull it off requires a certain degree to which people at large need to be informed… which I am fairly sure is never going to be possible.",
        "From life, we can find that organic food is becoming more and more popular.",
